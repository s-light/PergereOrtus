# touch(less) input
buildin / hidden in the top outer edge is a copper surface that acts as electrode.
it is split in 4 parts and managed with an [FDC1004](https://github.com/s-light/TI_FDC1004_Breakout) or similar


# top input rim
## self build encoder
on underside of rim is a black/white pattern printed.  
(check that printing is really black for IR!!)
then read with two reflective ir sensor.
classical encoder gray-code pattern thing...
