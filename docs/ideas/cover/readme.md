## ideas
### original
i think a lid/cover that (eventually) can open and close to 'protect' the glass is a good idea.
on the top of the lid i think a [Flower of Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_circles_grid) [(Blume des Lebens)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blume_des_Lebens) or [something similar](https://openclipart.org/detail/17495/decorative-flower) is a good art-work.
for example:
![Flower of Live](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Flower-of-Life-small.svg)
or
![Flower](https://openclipart.org/download/17495/lemmling-Decorative-flower.svg)

### update 25.07.2018
its better to have a cover that can be taken away and placed on the bottom -
so you can release it from the top and attach it at the bottom -
then it is not in the way (the device is view-able from all around)...

## features
- attach / detach safely to the main housing (some release mechanism is needed)
- glowing crystal like structure at the top
- artwork
