## ideas

### original
i think a lid/cover that can open and close (eventually automatic)
to 'protect' the glass is a good idea.


### update 25.07.2018
its better to have a cover that can be taken away -
so you also have nothing additionally laying around but
the lid is not in the way (the device is view-able from all around)...
â†’ release it from the top and attach it at the bottom
(locks in place at both positions)

## features
- attach / detach safely to the main housing (some release mechanism is needed)
- glowing crystal like structure at the top
- artwork

### release mechanism
ideas
- some push/toggle button on all four sides
- one or multiple (two or four) small rotating discs/locks
- spring-loaded mechanism for 'attach'
    - must be visually nice if not in use..

### top crystal cone
transparent acrylic glass
on the inside add on some 2mm crushed glass or similar to create a 'mystical'
crystal effect.

### artwork
on the top of the lid i think a [Flower of Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_circles_grid) [(Blume des Lebens)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blume_des_Lebens) or [something similar](https://openclipart.org/detail/17495/decorative-flower) is a good art-work.
for example:
![Flower of Live](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Flower-of-Life-small.svg)
or
![Flower](https://openclipart.org/download/17495/lemmling-Decorative-flower.svg)
