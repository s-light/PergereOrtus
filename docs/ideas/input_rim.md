## features
- easy smooth moving by hand
- automatic moving by hidden motor
- push action

## self build encoder
on underside of rim is a black/white pattern printed.  
(check that printing is really black for IR!!)
then read with two reflective ir sensor.
classical encoder gray-code pattern thing...

## absolute position
for absolute position it would be possible to use a color sensor with an rainbow circle on the rim.

## push action
ring could be mounted on small springs -
this way the springs could be measured inductively.
this could give a pressure reading.
